The goal for this project was to model the relationship between hurricane central pressure and max wind speed, and then assess the impact of climate change on the number and strength of hurricanes in the atlantic basin. 

/Code contains all R code files for analysis 

/Data contains the relevant dataset of hurricanes 

/Report contains a PDF file detailing the results of the analysis, ultimately concluding that hurricanes are increasing in both frequency and strength over time
